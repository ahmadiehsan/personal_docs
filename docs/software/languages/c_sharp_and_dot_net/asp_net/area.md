# Area

## Description

- We can split our application into the multiple sub MVC or RazorPage projects with area
- Itâ€™s useful when we have different functionalities for admins and regular users
- In the bellow image we can see a project with two areas:

  <img src="image1.jpg" style="width:1.42083in" />

- By adding area feature into the project, we should change our default url pattern to something like this:

  <img src="image2.jpg" style="width:5.1in" />
