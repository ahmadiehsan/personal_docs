# SAML

## Overview

SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) is an XML-based protocol designed for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties in a secure and standardized manner. It facilitates Single Sign-On (SSO) and enables the secure exchange of user information between an Identity Provider (IdP) and a Service Provider (SP).

### Bindings

- Supports different bindings for transmitting assertions and messages over various communication protocols (e.g., HTTP POST, HTTP Redirect).

### Profiles
