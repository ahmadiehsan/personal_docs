# WebRTC [UDP]

## Description

- WebRTC is designed for high-performance, high-quality communication of video, audio, and arbitrary data. In other words, for apps exactly like what you describe.
- WebRTC is mainly **UDP**, with WebRTC you may achieve low latency and smooth playback which is crucial stuff for VoIP communications.
- When building a video/audio/text chat, webRTC is a good choice since it uses peer-to-peer technology and once the connection is up and running, you do not need to pass the communication via a server (unless using TURN).
- Webrtc is a part of **peer to peer** connection
- It is perfect for use cases such as voice and video calls, online conferencing, and chat.
