# Hash Search {Adaptive}

## Description

Uses a hash table to establish a key-value mapping between search data and target data, thus implementing the query operation.

The advantage of this algorithm is high efficiency, **with time complexities reaching $O(\log n)$ or even $O(1)$**.

!!! info

    Using this algorithm often requires data preprocessing.
    For example, requires the help of additional data structures.
    Maintaining these structures also requires more overhead in terms of time and space.
