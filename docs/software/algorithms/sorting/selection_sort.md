# Selection Sort [$O(n^2)$] [Non-Stable] [In-Place]

## Description

Selection sort works on a very simple principle: it uses a loop where each iteration selects the smallest element from the unsorted interval and moves it to the end of the sorted section.

## Workflow

Suppose the length of the array is $n$, the steps of selection sort are:

1. Initially, all elements are unsorted, i.e., the unsorted (index) interval is $[0, n - 1]$.
2. Select the smallest element in the interval $[0, n - 1]$ and swap it with the element at index 0. After this, the first element of the array is sorted.
3. Select the smallest element in the interval $[1, n - 1]$ and swap it with the element at index 1. After this, the first two elements of the array are sorted.
4. Continue in this manner. After $n - 1$ rounds of selection and swapping, the first $n - 1$ elements are sorted.
5. The only remaining element is subsequently the largest element and does not need sorting, thus the array is sorted.

## Specifications

- **Time complexity of $O(n^2)$, non-adaptive sort**: There are $n - 1$ iterations in the outer loop, with the length of the unsorted section starting at $n$ in the first iteration and decreasing to $2$ in the last iteration, i.e., each outer loop iteration contains $n, n - 1, \ldots, 3, 2$ inner loop iterations respectively, summing up to $\frac{(n-1)(n+2)}{2}$.
- **Space complexity of $O(1)$, in-place sort**: Uses constant extra space with pointers $i$ and $j$.
- **Non-stable sort**: As shown in the following picture, an element `nums[i]` may be swapped to the right of an equal element, causing their relative order to change.
