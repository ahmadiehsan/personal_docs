# Tree Search

## Description

In a specific tree structure (such as a **binary search tree**), quickly eliminates nodes based on node value comparisons, thus locating the target element.

The advantage of this algorithm is high efficiency, **with time complexities reaching $O(\log n)$ or even $O(1)$**.

!!! info

    Using this algorithm often requires data preprocessing.
    For example, requires the help of additional data structures.
    Maintaining these structures also requires more overhead in terms of time and space.
