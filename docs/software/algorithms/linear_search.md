# Linear Search {Brute-Force}

## Description

Linear Search locates the target element by traversing every element of the data structure.

Is suitable for linear data structures such as **arrays** and **linked lists**.
It starts from one end of the data structure and accesses each element one by one until the target element is found or the other end is reached without finding the target element.

**Time complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements, so the performance is poor with large data sets.

    The advantage is its simplicity and versatility, **no need for data preprocessing or the help of additional data structures**.
