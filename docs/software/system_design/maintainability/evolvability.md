# Evolvability

## Description

Make it easy for engineers to make changes to the system in the future, adapting it for unanticipated use cases as requirements change. Also known as extensibility, modifiability, or plasticity.

Making change easy by allowing you to upgrade different parts of your system independently, and not having to change everything at once.
