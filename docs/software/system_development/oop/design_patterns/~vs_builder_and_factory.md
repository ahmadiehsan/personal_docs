# Vs (Builder & Factory)

## Description

The purpose of Builder is to construct complex objects step by step. It separates the construction of an object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

The purpose of Factory is to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. It delegates the instantiation logic to subclasses or methods.

Builder handles more complex object construction, while Factory focuses on simple object creation.

Builder is more flexible when dealing with objects that require a lot of configuration, whereas Factory is used for creating objects of related classes.

In short, use Builder when constructing complex objects step by step, and Factory when you need to create objects from a set of related classes without exposing the creation logic.
