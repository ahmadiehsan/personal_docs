# Facade (Simplified interface) [Structural]

## Description

![](facade/image1.jpg)

provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

To use the Facade Pattern, we create a class that simplifies and unifies a set of more complex classes that belong to some subsystem.

A facade not only simplifies an interface, it decouples a client from a subsystem of components.
