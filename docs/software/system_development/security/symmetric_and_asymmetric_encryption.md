# Symmetric & Asymmetric Encryption

## Symmetric

- In symmetric encryption, a single key is used for both the encryption and decryption of the data. This means that the same key is shared between the communicating parties.
- The main advantage of symmetric encryption is its speed and efficiency. It is generally faster than asymmetric encryption.
- However, the challenge lies in securely distributing and managing the shared key, especially when parties are not physically close.
- Common symmetric encryption algorithms include Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Data Encryption Standard (DES).

## Asymmetric

- Asymmetric encryption uses a pair of keys: a public key and a private key. The public key is shared openly, while the private key is kept secret.
- Any data encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the corresponding private key, and vice versa.
- Asymmetric encryption is more secure in terms of key distribution, as the private key remains secret and does not need to be shared.
- It is computationally more expensive than symmetric encryption, making it less efficient for large volumes of data.
- Common asymmetric encryption algorithms include RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) and ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography).
