# Logging

## Description

- Logging records discrete events in the system. For example, we can record an incoming request or a visit to databases as events. It has the highest volume
- ELK (Elastic-Logstash-Kibana) stack is often used to build a log analysis platform
- We often define a standardized logging format for different teams to implement, so that we can leverage keywords when searching among massive amounts of logs
