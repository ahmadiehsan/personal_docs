# Binary Tree

## Description

A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. The topmost node is called the root. The structure is recursive, as each child of a node can be the root of its own subtree.

- **Root node:** The node at the top level of the binary tree, which has no parent node.
- **Leaf node:** A node with no children, both of its pointers point to None.
- **Edge:** The line segment connecting two nodes, i.e., node reference (pointer).
- **The level of a node:** Incrementing from top to bottom, with the root node's level being 1.
- **The degree of a node:** The number of children a node has. In a binary tree, the degree can be 0, 1, or 2.
- **The height of a binary tree:** The number of edges passed from the root node to the farthest leaf node.
- **The depth of a node:** The number of edges passed from the root node to the node.
- **The height of a node:** The number of edges from the farthest leaf node to the node.
