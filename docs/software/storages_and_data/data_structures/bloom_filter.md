# Bloom Filter

## Description

Probabilistic data structure used to test whether an element is a member of a set.

A Bloom filter is a memory-efficient data structure for approximating the contents of a set. It can tell you if a key does not appear in the database, and thus saves many unnecessary disk reads for nonexistent keys.
