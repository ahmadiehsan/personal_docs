# MinIO

## Overview

- One of the best alternatives to S3, without any changes within the code, we can migrate from S3 to MinIO
- MinIO established itself as the standard for AWS S3 compatibility from its inception
- One of the earliest adopters of the S3 API (both V2 and V4) and one of the only storage companies to focus exclusively on S3
