# Durability

## Description

Durability ensures that once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent and survive any subsequent system failures (e.g., power outages or crashes).
The changes made by a committed transaction are stored in non-volatile memory, such as disk storage, and are not lost even if the system goes down.
