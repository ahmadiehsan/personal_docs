# Data Mesh

## Description

Data Mesh is an architectural paradigm that treats data as a product.
It decentralizes data ownership and architecture, allowing teams to develop, govern, and operate their own data domains.
It's a shift from monolithic, centralized data management to a more distributed approach.
