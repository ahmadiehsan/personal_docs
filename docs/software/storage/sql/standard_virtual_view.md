# Standard/Virtual View

## Description

"Standard (virtual) view" in SQL databases refers to a saved query that behaves like a table, presenting data from one or more tables in the database.
**It doesn't store data itself** but provides a dynamic, up-to-date representation of the underlying data based on the query's conditions.

Views themselves **do not** inherently make queries faster.
The performance impact depends on various factors such as the complexity of the underlying query, indexing, and database optimization.
In some cases, using views can improve performance by simplifying queries and promoting code reuse, but it's not a guarantee.
