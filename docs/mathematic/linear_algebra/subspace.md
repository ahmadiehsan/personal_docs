# Subspace

## Description

A subspace is any subset of R&lt;n&gt; which is also a vector space over R&lt;n&gt;.

When V (a random subset) is a subspace of R&lt;n&gt;, it means:

- V contains the zero vector
- If x&lt;vector&gt; is in V, for every scalar of it, the result is in V also
- if a&lt;vector&gt; is in V and b&lt;vector&gt; is in V, the addition of them is in V also

## Basis

A basis for a subspace S of R&lt;n&gt; is a set of vectors in S that is linearly independent and is maximal with this property (that is, adding any other vector in S to this subset makes the resulting set linearly dependent).

- A space can have multiple basis
- A basis should be linearly independent
- Two units i&lt;unit&gt; and j&lt;unit&gt; are **standard basis** of R&lt;2&gt;

## Kernel

The kernel of a linear map, also known as the null space, is the linear subspace of the domain of the map which is mapped to the zero vector.
