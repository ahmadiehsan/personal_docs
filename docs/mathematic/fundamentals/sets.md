# Sets

## Description

A set is an unordered collection of distinct objects, called elements or members of the set. A set is said to contain its elements. We write a ∈ A to denote that a is an element of the set A. The notation a ∉ A denotes that a is not an element of the set A.

## Popular sets

- N = {0, 1, 2, 3,…}, the set of all natural numbers
- Z = {…,−2,−1, 0, 1, 2,…}, the set of all integers
- Z+ = {1, 2, 3,…}, the set of all positive integers
- Q = {p∕q ∣ p ∈ Z,q ∈ Z, and q ≠ 0}, the set of all rational numbers
- R, the set of all real numbers
- R+, the set of all positive real numbers
- C is the set of all complex numbers

## Subsets

The set A is a subset of B, and B is a superset of A, if and only if every element of A is also an element of B. We use the notation A ⊆ B to indicate that A is a subset of the set B. If, instead, we want to stress that B is a superset of A, we use the equivalent notation B ⊇ A.(So, A ⊆ B and B ⊇ A are equivalent statements.)

## Operations

### Cartesian Products

Let A and B be sets. The Cartesian product of A and B, denoted by A × B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b), where a ∈ A and b ∈ B. Hence,

A × B ={(a, b) ∣ a ∈ A ∧ b ∈ B}

### Union

Let A and B be sets. The union of the sets A and B, denoted by A ∪ B, is the set that contains those elements that are either in A or in B, or in both.

### Intersection

Let A and B be sets. The intersection of the sets A and B, denoted by A ∩ B, is the set containing those elements in both A and B.

### Diﬀerence

Let A and B be sets. The diﬀerence of A and B, denoted by A − B, is the set containing those elements that are in A but not in B. The diﬀerence of A and B is also called the complement of B with respect to A.

### Complement

Let U be the universal set. The complement of the set A, denoted by -A, is the complement of A with respect to U. Therefore, the complement of the set -A is U − A
