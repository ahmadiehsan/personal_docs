# Variance

## Description

Whereas expectation provides a measure of centrality, the variance of a random variable quantifies the spread of that random variable's distribution. The variance is the average value of the squared difference between the random variable and its expectation.

Variance is a measure of dispersion, meaning it is a measure of how far a set of numbers is spread out from their average value.

## Vs Mean

The mean is the average of a group of numbers, and the variance measures the average degree to which each number is different from the mean.
