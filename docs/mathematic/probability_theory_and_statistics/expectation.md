# Expectation

## Description

The expected value of a discrete random variable X, symbolized as E(X), is often referred to as the long-term average or mean (symbolized as Î¼).

The expectation of a random variable is a number that attempts to capture the center of that random variable's distribution. It can be interpreted as the long-run average of many independent samples from the given distribution.

## Formula

It is defined as the probability-weighted sum of all possible values in the random variable's support.
