# Covariance

## Description

We use this concept to understand relationships between features.

We can quantify the relationship between features and then use this learning to either select, add, or alter features for predictive modeling, insight generation, or even storytelling using data.

## Formula

Covariance assumes the units from the product of the units of the two variables involved in its formula.

- Covariance can take any value between -∞ and +∞.
- **The change in scale of the features affects the value of covariance**. If we multiply all the values of the given feature by a constant and all the values of another feature by a similar or different constant, then **the value of covariance also changes**.
