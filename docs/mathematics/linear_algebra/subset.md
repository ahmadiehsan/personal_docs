# Subset

## Description

A subset of $R_n$ is any set that contains only elements of $R_n$. For example, ${x_0}$ is a subset of $R_n$ if $x_0$ is an element of $R_n$.

## Linear Combination

In mathematics, a linear combination is an expression constructed from a set of terms by multiplying each term by a constant and adding the results (e.g. a linear combination of $x$ and $y$ would be any expression of the form $ax + by$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants).

- By applying the linear combination over two Vectors we can represent every 2D possible Vector in the world!

## Span

The **linear span** (also called the linear hull or just span) of a set $S$ of vectors (from a vector space), denoted $span(S)$, is defined as the set of all linear combinations of the vectors in $S$.

## Linear Dependent & Linear Independent

A set of vectors is **linearly dependent** if there is a nontrivial linear combination of the vectors that equals 0.

A set of vectors is **linearly independent** if the only linear combination of the vectors that equals 0 is the trivial linear combination (i.e., all coefficients = 0).
