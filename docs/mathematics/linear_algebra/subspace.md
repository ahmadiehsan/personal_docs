# Subspace

## Description

A subspace is any subset of $R_n$ which is also a vector space over $R_n$.

When $V$ (a random subset) is a subspace of $R_n$, it means:

- $V$ contains the zero vector
- If $\vec{x}$ is in $V$, for every scalar of it, the result is in $V$ also
- if $\vec{a}$ is in $V$ and $\vec{b}$ is in $V$, the addition of them is in $V$ also

## Basis

A basis for a subspace $S$ of $R_n$ is a set of vectors in $S$ that is linearly independent and is maximal with this property (that is, adding any other vector in $S$ to this subset makes the resulting set linearly dependent).

- A space can have multiple basis
- A basis should be linearly independent
- Two units $i$ and $j$ are **standard basis** of $R_2$

## Kernel

The kernel of a linear map, also known as the null space, is the linear subspace of the domain of the map which is mapped to the zero vector.
