# Variance

## Description

Whereas expectation provides a measure of centrality, the variance of a random variable quantifies the spread of that random variable's distribution. The variance is the average value of the squared difference between the random variable and its expectation.

Variance is a measure of dispersion, meaning it is a measure of how far a set of numbers is spread out from their average value.

## Formula

The variance is the average value of the squared difference between the random variable and its expectation

$$
\text{Var}(X) = E[(X - E[X])^2]
$$

Or in other shape:

Variance is the expectation of the squared deviation of a random variable from its population mean or sample mean.

$$
S^2 = \frac{\sum{(x_i - \bar{x})^2}}{n - 1}
$$

- $S^2$ = sample variance
- $x_i$ = the value of one observation
- $\bar{x}$ = the mean value of all observations
- $n$ = the number of observations

## Vs Mean

The mean is the average of a group of numbers, and the variance measures the average degree to which each number is different from the mean.
