# Vs (Correlation & Covariance)

## Description

- Both covariance and correlation measure the relationship and the dependency between two variables.
- Covariance indicates the direction of the linear relationship between variables.
- Correlation measures both the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables.
- Correlation values are standardized.
- Covariance values are not standardized.
- While correlation coefficients lie between $-1$ and $+1$, covariance can take any value between $-\infty$ and $+\infty$.
- Correlation is dimensionless. It's a unit-free measure of the relationship between variables. This is because we divide the value of covariance by the product of standard deviations which have the same units.
