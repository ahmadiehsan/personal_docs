# Functions

## Description

Let $A$ and $B$ be nonempty sets. A function $f$ from $A$ to $B$ is an assignment of exactly one element of $B$ to each element of $A$. We write $f(a) = b$ if $b$ is the unique element of $B$ assigned by the function $f$ to the element $a$ of $A$. If $f$ is a function from $A$ to $B$, we write $f: A \rightarrow B$

## Result of Set Under a Function

### Image

Let $f$ be a function from $A$ to $B$ and let $S$ be a subset of $A$. The image of $S$ under the function $f$ is the subset of $B$ that consists of the images of the elements of $S$. We denote the image of $S$ by $f(S)$, so

$f(S) = \{ t \mid \exists s \in S, \ t = f(s) \}$

We also use the shorthand $\{ f(s) \mid s \in S \}$ to denote this set.

The image of a function is the set of all output values it may produce.

$f$ is a function from domain $X$ to codomain $Y$. The yellow oval inside $Y$ is the image of $f$.

### Preimage

For a given function, the set of all elements of the domain that are mapped into a given subset of the codomain.

$f^{-1}(Y)$

## Function Types

### One to One Function (Injective)

A function $f$ is said to be one-to-one, or an injection, if and only if $f(x) = f(y)$ implies that $x = y$ for all $x$ and $y$ in the domain of $f$.

A function is said to be injective if it is one-to-one.

### Increasing and Decreasing Function

A function $f$ whose domain and codomain are subsets of the set of real numbers is called increasing if $f(x) ≤ f(y)$, and strictly increasing if $f(x) < f(y)$, whenever $x < y$ and $x$ and $y$ are in the domain of $f$. Similarly, $f$ is called decreasing if $f(x) ≥ f(y)$, and strictly decreasing if $f(x) > f(y)$, whenever $x < y$ and $x$ and $y$ are in the domain of $f$. (The word strictly in this deﬁnition indicates a strict inequality.)

### Onto Function (Surjective)

A function $f$ from $X$ to $Y$ is called onto, or a surjection, if and only if for every element $y \in Y$ there is at least an element $x \in X$ with $f(x) = y$.

A function $f$ is called surjective if it is onto.

### Identity Function

Is a function that always returns the value that was used as its argument, unchanged. That is, when f is the identity function, the equality $f(X) = X$ is true for all values of $X$ to which $f$ can be applied.

We will show this function by $I$ (capital $i$).

### Invertible Function

A function is invertible if and only if is a onto and one-to-one function.

## Composition

Let $g$ be a function from the set $A$ to the set $B$ and let $f$ be a function from the set $B$ to the set $C$. The composition of the functions $f$ and $g$, denoted for all $a \in A$ by $f \circ g$, is the function from $A$ to $C$ deﬁned by

$(f \circ g)(a) = f(g(a))$
