## Boolean Searches

Logical connectives are used extensively in searches of large collections of information, such as indexes of Web pages.
Because these searches employ techniques from propositional logic, Links are called Boolean searches.

In Boolean searches, the connective AND is used to match records that contain both of two search terms, the connective OR is used to match one or both of two search terms and the connective NOT (sometimes written as AND NOT) is used to exclude a particular search term.

Careful planning of how logical connectives are used is often required when Boolean searches are used to locate information of potential interest.
Example 6 illustrates how Boolean searches are carried out.
