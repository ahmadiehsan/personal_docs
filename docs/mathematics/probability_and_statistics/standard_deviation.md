# Standard Deviation

## Description

The standard deviation is the average amount of variability in your dataset.
It tells you, on average, how far each value lies from the mean.
A high standard deviation means that values are generally far from the mean, while a low standard deviation indicates that values are clustered close to the mean.

## Formula

$$
\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum{(x_i - \mu)^2}}{N}}
$$

- $\sigma$ = population standard deviation
- $N$ = the size of the population
- $x_i$ = each value from the population
- $\mu$ = the population mean
