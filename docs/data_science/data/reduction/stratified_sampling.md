# Stratified Sampling [Sampling]

## Description

To avoid the drawbacks of simple random sampling, you can **divide the population to several groups according to your requirements, for example the labels, and sample from each group separately.** Each group is called a stratum and this method is called stratified sampling.

For example, to sample 1% of a population that has classes A and B, you can divide the population to two groups and sample 1% from the two groups, respectively.
In this way, **no matter how rare A or B is, the sampled subsets are ensured to contain both of the two classes.**

However, a drawback of stratified sampling is that the population is not always divisible.
For example, in a multi-label learning task in which each sample has multiple labels, it is challenging to divide the population according to different labels.
