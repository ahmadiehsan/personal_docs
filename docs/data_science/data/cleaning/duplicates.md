# Duplicates

## Description

Eliminating duplicates is a prevalent preprocessing measure that's employed to cleanse datasets by detecting and removing identical records. The occurrence of duplicate records may be attributed to factors such as data entry errors, system glitches, or data merging processes. The presence of duplicates can skew models and yield inaccurate insights. Hence, it is imperative to recognize and eliminate duplicate records to uphold the accuracy and dependability of the dataset.

There are different methods for removing duplicates in a dataset:

- The most common method is to **compare all the rows** of the dataset to identify duplicate records. If two or more rows have the same values in all the columns, they are considered duplicates. In some cases, it may be necessary to compare only a subset of columns if certain columns are more prone to duplicates.
- Another method is to use a **unique identifier column** to identify duplicates. A unique identifier column is a column that contains unique values for each record, such as an ID number or a combination of unique columns. By comparing the unique identifier column, it is possible to identify and remove duplicate records from the dataset.

After identifying the duplicate records, the next step is to decide which records to keep and which ones to remove. One approach is to **keep the first** occurrence of a duplicate record and remove all subsequent occurrences. Another approach is to **keep the record with the most complete information**, or the record with the most recent timestamp.
