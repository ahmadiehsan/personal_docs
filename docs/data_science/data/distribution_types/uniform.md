## Description

The simplest distribution where all outcomes in a given range are equally likely.

It's like rolling a fair die or picking a random number between 0 and 1, with no preference for any particular value in the range.

## Examples

- Long-tail keywords in SEO: A few high-volume keywords (like "shoes") get massive search volume, but there's a long tail of specific, niche searches (like "waterproof hiking shoes for wide feet") that collectively make up most of the search traffic. These long-tail keywords aren't often searched for, but they convert well.
- Book sales: Bestsellers like Harry Potter dominate the market, but tons of niche books (even classics like Jane Austen) sell steadily in the background. The collective sales of these less popular books often exceed those of the bestsellers.
- Luxury bags: A few brands are always trending. However, there's a long list of unique, lesser-known ones that still sell and matter to the market.
