# Long Tail

## Description

This describes data where a few items occur very frequently, but a large number of items appear rarely, creating a "long tail" in the distribution.

It's common in natural and social phenomena like word usage, wealth, or website visits, where rare events collectively matter a lot despite their low individual frequency.
