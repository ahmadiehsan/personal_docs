# Normal [Bell Curve] [Gaussian]

## Description

The classic bell-shaped curve, symmetric around the mean, where data clusters around an average value with decreasing probability toward the extremes.

Itâ€™s fundamental in statistics because many natural processes and measurement errors approximate this shape due to the Central Limit Theorem.
