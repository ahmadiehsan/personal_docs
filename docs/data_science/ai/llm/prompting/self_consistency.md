# Self-Consistency

## Description

Self-consistency is an advanced technique aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of prompt engineering. It involves sampling multiple reasoning paths using few-shot examples to identify the most reliable answer. This method significantly improves performance, particularly in tasks requiring arithmetic and commonsense reasoning.

Example Application: Consider a problem where a person is asked about their sister's age based on a past age relationship. Using self-consistency, various outputs are generated, and the most frequent answer is selected as the final response. This approach minimizes errors and increases accuracy.
