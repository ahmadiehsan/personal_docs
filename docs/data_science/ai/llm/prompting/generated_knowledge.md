Methodology:

- **Knowledge Generation**: First, the model generates specific knowledge based on prompts. For example, providing detailed information about subjects such as geography, biology, or common misconceptions.
- **Integration with Queries**: Next, the generated knowledge is formatted into a question-and-answer style to guide the model's responses.
