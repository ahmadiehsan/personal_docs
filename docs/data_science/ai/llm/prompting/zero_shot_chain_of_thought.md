# Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought

## Description

Is a great method for enhancing the output of a generative model, it does require one or more examples of reasoning in the prompt, which the user might not have access to.

Instead of providing examples, we can simply ask the generative model to provide the reasoning (zero-shot chain-of-thought).

There are many different forms that work but a common and effective method is to use the phrase “Let’s think step-by-step, ...”

!!! info

    Although the prompt “Let’s think step by step” can improve the output, you are not constrained by this exact formulation. Alternatives exist like “Take a deep breath and think step-by-step” and “Let’s work through this problem step-by-step.”
