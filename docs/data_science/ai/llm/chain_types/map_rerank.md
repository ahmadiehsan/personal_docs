# Map-Rerank

## Description

The Map-Rerank chain is designed to address tasks that require identifying the best output from multiple documents by scoring or ranking the results. This method generates responses for each document in a collection (mapping phase) and then ranks them to select the most relevant or optimal output (rerank phase).

Advantages:

- **Improved output quality**: By evaluating and ranking outputs, the Map-Rerank chain ensures the selection of the most accurate and contextually appropriate response.
- **Focused information extraction**: Instead of synthesizing all document outputs, it filters for the best answer, reducing noise and irrelevant details.
- **Scalability**: Handles large sets of documents by individually processing them and selecting the best result, making it efficient for tasks with high document volume.

Disadvantages:

- **Ranking complexity**: The reranking phase requires a scoring mechanism that must be well-designed to evaluate and rank outputs accurately.
- **Potential for bias**: The scoring system may favor certain outputs depending on the criteria used, which could introduce bias.
- **Computational overhead**: Processing all documents (mapping phase) and then reranking them can require significant resources for large datasets.

## Use Cases

- **Document-based question answering**: For example, when answering a question from a set of legal or scientific documents, the Map-Rerank chain identifies the most accurate and relevant answer from the set.
- **Search result optimization**: Enhances search engines by scoring and ranking the results to present the most relevant response.
- **Recommendation systems**: Helps in ranking products, services, or other recommendations based on user preferences by processing each option individually and reranking.
- **Summarization with ranking**: Generates multiple summaries for a document collection, then ranks them to produce the most comprehensive and accurate summary.
