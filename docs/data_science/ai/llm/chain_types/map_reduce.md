# Map-Reduce

## Description

The map-reduce chain iterates over a list of documents, generating individual outputs for each and then combining them into a final result. This approach is particularly useful for tasks requiring parallel document processing followed by aggregation.

## Benefits

- **Parallel processing**: Allows parallel execution on individual documents, improving efficiency and reducing processing time.
- **Scalability**: Handles large document collections by distributing the processing load.
- **Enhanced information extraction**: Generates specific information from each document, contributing to a comprehensive final result.

## Disadvantages

- **Complexity in output aggregation**: Requires careful handling to ensure coherency and meaningful synthesis.
- **Potential redundancy**: May generate redundant information, necessitating further post-processing.

## Use Cases

- **Multiple Document Summarization**: Summarizes individual research papers, then merges them into a comprehensive summary capturing key information from the entire collection.
