# Overview

## Description

Fine-tuning involves taking a pretrained model and customizing it for a specific downstream task by training it further on a task-specific dataset. It adjusts the existing weights of the model to optimize performance for new, task-specific objectives.

- **Task-Specific**: Fine-tuning is explicitly tailored for a specific task (e.g., text classification, sentiment analysis, image segmentation).
- **Requires Labeled Data**: The task dataset often requires labeled examples for supervised learning.
- **Adjusts Pretrained Weights**: The pretrained weights of the model are updated during fine-tuning, enabling the model to specialize in the downstream task.
- **Typically Large Data Needs**: Depending on the model and task complexity, fine-tuning often requires a substantial amount of labeled task-specific data.

## Usage

- When the pretrained model doesnâ€™t perform well on a specific task out of the box.
- If you have access to a moderately sized or large labeled dataset for your target task.
- For complex tasks that require significant task-specific adjustment of the original model weights.
