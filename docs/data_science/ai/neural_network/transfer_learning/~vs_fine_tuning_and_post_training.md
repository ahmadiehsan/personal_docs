# Vs (Fine-Tuning & Post-Training)

## Overview

| **Aspect**            | **Fine-Tuning**                             | **Post-Training**                               |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Objective**         | Task-specific customization                 | Domain or general-purpose adaptation            |
| **Data Required**     | Labeled task-specific data                  | Unlabeled or lightly supervised domain data     |
| **Weight Updates**    | Extensive adjustments to pretrained weights | Limited or targeted adjustments                 |
| **Focus**             | Optimizes performance for a specific task   | Broad domain adaptation or general improvements |
| **Parameter Updates** | Full or partial model training              | Often fewer parameters are updated              |
| **Examples**          | Sentiment analysis, image classification    | Legal text adaptation, clinical document tuning |

## Deciding

- **Availability of Labeled Data**: If labeled data is scarce, post-training might be more appropriate as it relies on unlabeled data; fine-tuning needs more labeled examples.
- **Task vs. Domain**: If your goal is to optimize for a single task, choose fine-tuning. If you want broader performance improvements in a domain, consider post-training.
- **Compute Resources**: Fine-tuning typically requires more computational resources since it may involve training all layers of the model. Post-training is often more lightweight.
- **Model Overfitting Risk**: Fine-tuning can cause overfitting if the labeled dataset is too smallâ€”consider strategies like freeze-training or regularization. Post-training is less prone to overfitting since it uses broader and unlabeled data.
