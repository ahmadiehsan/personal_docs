# Post-Training

## Description

Post-training focuses on refining a pretrained model without task-specific labeled data. It adapts the model to work better in new contexts or domains where the data distribution differs from what the model was originally trained on. Post-training techniques typically adjust the model for unsupervised or lightly supervised objectives.

- **Domain Adaptation**: Post-training is commonly used to adapt a model to a new domain (e.g., fine-tuning an English language model for biomedical literature).
- **No Strict Labels Needed**: Post-training often uses unlabeled or semi-supervised data from the target domain.
- **Focused on Generalization**: Instead of specializing in a single task, post-training enhances the modelâ€™s general understanding of the new domain or dataset.
- **Minimal Change to Weights**: Post-training typically updates fewer parameters compared to fine-tuning (e.g., only the embeddings or specific layers).

## Usage

- When the pretrained model performs reasonably well on many tasks but underperforms for a specific domain.
- If task-specific labeled data is unavailable or scarce.
- For general-purpose improvement in a domain before applying to downstream tasks (e.g., healthcare, legal documents).
