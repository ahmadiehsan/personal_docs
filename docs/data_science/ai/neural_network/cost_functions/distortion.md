# Distortion [Signal Processing]

## Description

- **Use case**: Signal processing or system performance evaluation
- **When to use**: Measures how much signal degradation or alteration occurs during processes like data compression, reconstruction, or transmission. Itâ€™s typically used in communication systems, image/audio processing, or multimedia applications.
- **Key property:** It quantifies how similar or different the output signal is from the original, typically in tasks where preservation of signal integrity is important.
- **Common measures for distortion**:

   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)

- **Example applications**:

   - Assessing audio or video compression quality
   - Measuring fidelity in reconstructed images
