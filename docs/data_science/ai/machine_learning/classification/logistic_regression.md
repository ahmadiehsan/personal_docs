# Logistic Regression [Sup]

## Specifications

- **Cost Function:** Log Loss, Squared Error Loss

## Description

While linear regression is leveraged when dependent variables are continuous, logistical regression is selected when the dependent variable is categorical, meaning they have binary outputs, such as "true" and "false" or "yes" and "no." While both regression models seek to understand relationships between data inputs, logistic regression is mainly used to solve binary classification problems, such as spam identification.
