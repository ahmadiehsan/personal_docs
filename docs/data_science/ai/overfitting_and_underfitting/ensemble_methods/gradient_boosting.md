# Gradient Boosting

## Description

Gradient boosting is another ensemble model that can be used for classification and regression tasks. It works by getting a weak classifier (such as a simple tree), and in each step tries to improve this weak classifier to build a better model. The main idea here is that the model tries to focus on its mistakes in each step and improve itself by fitting the model by correcting the errors made in previous trees.

During each iteration, the algorithm computes the negative gradient of the loss function concerning the predicted values, followed by fitting a decision tree to these negative gradient values. The predictions of the new tree are then combined with the predictions of the previous trees, using a learning rate parameter that controls the contribution of each tree to the final prediction.

The overall prediction of the gradient boosting model is obtained by summing up the predictions of all the trees, which are weighted by their respective learning rates.

Let’s look at some of the advantages of gradient boosting:

- High prediction accuracy
- Handles both regression and classification problems
- Can handle missing data and outliers
- Can be used with various loss functions
- Can handle high-dimensional data

Now, let’s look at some of the disadvantages:

- Sensitive to overfitting, especially when the number of trees is large
- Computationally expensive and time-consuming to train, especially for large datasets
- Requires careful tuning of hyperparameters, such as the number of trees, the learning rate, and the maximum depth of the trees
