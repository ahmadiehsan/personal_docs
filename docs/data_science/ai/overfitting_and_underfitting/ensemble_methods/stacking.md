# Stacking

## Description

Stacking is another popular ensemble learning technique that combines the predictions of multiple base models by training a higher-level model on their predictions. The idea behind stacking is to leverage the strengths of different base models to achieve better predictive performance.

Hereâ€™s how stacking works:

1. Divide the training data into two parts: the first part is used to train the base models, while the second part is used to create a new dataset of predictions from the base models.

2. Train multiple base models on the first part of the training data.

3. Use the trained base models to make predictions on the second part of the training data to create a new dataset of predictions.

4. Train a higher-level model (also known as a metamodel or blender) on the new dataset of predictions.

5. Use the trained higher-level model to make predictions on the test data.

The higher-level model is typically a simple model such as a linear regression, logistic regression, or a decision tree. The idea is to use the predictions of the base models as input features for the higher-level model. This way, the higher-level model learns to combine the predictions of the base models to make more accurate predictions.
