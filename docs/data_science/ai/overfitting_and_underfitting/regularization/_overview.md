## Description

Is a technique that's used to add a penalty term to the loss function during training, which helps to reduce the complexity of the model and prevent overfitting.

There are different types of regularization, including:

- L1 regularization (LASSO)
- L2 regularization (Ridge)
- Elastic net regularization
