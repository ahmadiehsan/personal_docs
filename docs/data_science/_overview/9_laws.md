# 9 Laws

## Description

1. **Business Goals Law**: Business objectives are the origin of every data mining solution. A data miner is someone who discovers useful information from data to support specific business goals. Data mining isn't defined by the tool you use.
2. **Business Knowledge Law**: Business Knowledge is central to every step of the data mining process. You don't have to be a fancy statistician to do data mining, but you do have to know something about what the data signifies and how the business works.
3. **Data Preparation Law**: Data preparation is more than half of every data mining process. Pretty much every data miner will spend more time on data preparation than on analysis.
4. **No Free Lunch for the Data Miner**: The right model for a given application can only be discovered by experiment. In data mining, models are selected through trial and error.
5. **Pattern Law**: There are always patterns in the data. As a data miner, you explore data in search of useful patterns. Understanding patterns in the data enables you to influence what happens in the future.
6. **Insight Law**: Data mining amplifies perception in the business domain. Data mining methods enable you to understand your business better than you could have done without them.
7. **Prediction Law**: Prediction increases information locally by generalization. Data mining helps us use what we know to make better predictions (or estimates) of things we don't know.
8. **Value Law**: The value of data mining results is not determined by the accuracy or stability of predictive models. Your model must produce good predictions, consistently. That's it.
9. **Law of Change**: All patterns are subject to change. Any model that gives you great predictions today may be useless tomorrow.
