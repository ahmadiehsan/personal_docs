# Histogram {Continuous}

## Description

A histogram is a chart that plots the distribution of a numeric variable's values as a series of bars. Each bar typically covers a range of numeric values called a bin or class; a bar's height indicates the frequency of data points with a value within the corresponding bin.

For example instead of showing our data like the image below:

<img src="image2.jpg" style="width:3.69528in" />

We will show it like the below in splitted **bins**:

<img src="image1.jpg" style="width:3.72972in" />
