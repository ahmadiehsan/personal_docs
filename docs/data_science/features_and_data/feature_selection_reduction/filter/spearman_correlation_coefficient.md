# Spearman Correlation Coefficient (Rs or ρ) [Not Normal] [2 Continuous]

## Description

The Spearman Correlation Coefficient, denoted as Rs (ρ), is a non-parametric measure of statistical dependence between two variables. It assesses how well the relationship between the variables can be described by a monotonic function. Unlike Pearson's correlation, which measures linear relationships, Spearman's correlation evaluates the rank-order relationship.

Spearman's correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1:

- 1 indicates a perfect positive monotonic relationship
- -1 indicates a perfect negative monotonic relationship
- 0 indicates no monotonic relationship

## Formula

To compute it:

1. Convert the raw scores to ranks.

2. Find the difference between the ranks for each pair of data points.

3. Apply the formula
