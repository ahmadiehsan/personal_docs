# T-Test [Normal] [Continuous vs Categorical]

## Description

A t-test is a statistical method used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups. It's commonly used when you have a small sample size and want to compare the means to see if they are different from each other.

There are two main types:

- **Independent t-test (Two-sample t-test):** Used when comparing the means of two independent groups (e.g., test scores of two different classes).
- **Paired t-test (Dependent t-test):** Used when comparing means from the same group at different times (e.g., before and after a treatment on the same group).

Key Concepts:

- **Null Hypothesis (H0):** Assumes no difference between group means.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** Assumes a difference exists.
- **p-value:** Helps decide if the observed difference is statistically significant. A p-value less than 0.05 typically indicates significance.

You run a t-test to find out if the difference in means is due to chance or if it reflects a true difference in the population.
