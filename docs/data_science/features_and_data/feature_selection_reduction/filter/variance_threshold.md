# Variance Threshold [Not Normal] [1 Continuous]

## Description

Variance Threshold is a baseline approach to feature selection. As the name suggests, it drops all features where the variance along the column does not exceed a threshold value. The premise is that a feature that doesnâ€™t vary much within itself, has very little predictive power.
