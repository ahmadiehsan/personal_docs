# Point-Biserial Correlation Coefficient (Rpb) [Normal] [Continuous vs Binary]

## Description

The Point-Biserial Correlation Coefficient (Rpb) is a measure of the strength and direction of the association between a binary variable (dichotomous) and a continuous variable. Itâ€™s a special case of the Pearson correlation coefficient, used when one variable is dichotomous (e.g., yes/no, male/female) and the other is continuous (e.g., test scores).

This coefficient ranges from -1 to 1, where values closer to 1 or -1 indicate a stronger relationship.
