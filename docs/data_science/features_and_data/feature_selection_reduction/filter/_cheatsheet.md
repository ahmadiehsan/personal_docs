When to use which technique

|                                     | Parametric Tests            | Nonparametric Tests          |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|
| One Sample                          | Simple t-Test               | Wilcoxon test for one sample |
| Two dependent samples               | Paired Sample t-Test        | Wilcoxon Test                |
| Two independent samples             | Unpaired Sample t-Test      | Mann-Whitney U Test          |
| More than two independent samples   | One factorial ANOVA         | Kruskal-Wallis Test          |
| More than two dependent samples     | Repeated Measures ANOVA     | Friedman Test                |
| Correlation between two variables   | Pearson correlation         | Spearman's rank correlation  |

Parametric tests:

- Data normally distributed
- e.g. the t-test, the analysis of variance, or the Pearson correlation

Non-parametric tests:

- Data not normally distributed
- e.g. the Mann-Whitney U test or the Spearman correlation
