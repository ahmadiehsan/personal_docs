# ANOVA [Normal] [Continuous vs Categorical]

## Description

ANOVA stands for Analysis of Variance, which is a statistical method used to analyze whether there are significant differences between the means of three or more groups. It's commonly used in experiments or studies where you want to compare multiple groups to see if there's a statistically significant difference between them. It's like an extended version of a t-test but for more than two groups.
