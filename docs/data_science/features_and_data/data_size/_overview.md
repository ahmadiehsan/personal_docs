# Overview

## Description

Numerosity Reduction is a data reduction technique which replaces the original data by a smaller form of data representation.

There are two techniques for numerosity reduction:

- Parametric
- Non-Parametric

Numerosity reduction is a technique used in data mining to reduce the number of data points in a dataset while still preserving the most important information. This can be beneficial in situations where the dataset is too large to be processed efficiently, or where the dataset contains a large amount of irrelevant or redundant data points.

It's important to note that numerosity reduction can have a trade-off between the accuracy and the size of the data. The more data points are reduced, the less accurate the model will be and the less generalizable it will be.
