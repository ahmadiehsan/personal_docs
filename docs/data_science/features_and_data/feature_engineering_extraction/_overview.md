# _Overview

## Description

Is manually generating new features from existing features, by applying some transformation or performing some operation on them.

Feature engineering is a machine learning technique that leverages data to create new variables that aren't in the training set. It can produce new features for both supervised and unsupervised learning, to simplify and speed up data transformations while also enhancing model accuracy.
