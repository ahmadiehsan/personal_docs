# One-Hot Encoding

## Specifications

- **Good for:** Low number of values

## Description

Considering we have the numeric representation of any categorical attribute with m labels (after transformation), the one-hot encoding scheme encodes or transforms the attribute into m binary features which can only contain a value of 1 or 0. Each observation in the categorical feature is thus converted into a vector of size m with only one of the values as 1 (indicating it as active).
