# Transforming Ordinal Attributes

## Description

Ordinal attributes are categorical attributes with a sense of order among the values.

Shoe sizes, education levels, and employment roles are some examples of ordinal categorical attributes.

## Example

In general, there is no generic module or function to map and transform these features into numeric representations based on order automatically.

Hence we can use a custom encoding\\mapping scheme.
