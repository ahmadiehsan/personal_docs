# Factor Analysis {Linear}

## Description

A technique that is used to reduce a large number of variables into fewer numbers of factors.
The values of observed data are expressed as functions of several possible causes to find which are the most important.
The observations are assumed to be caused by a linear transformation of lower dimensional latent factors and added Gaussian noise.
