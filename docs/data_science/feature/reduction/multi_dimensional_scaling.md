# Multi-dimensional Scaling (MDS) {Manifold}

## Description

A technique used for analyzing similarity or dissimilarity of data as distances in geometric spaces. Projects data to a lower dimension such that data points that are close to each other (in terms of Euclidean distance) in the higher dimension are close in the lower dimension as well.
