# Recall (TPR) [Imbalance]

## Description

Recall, also recognized as sensitivity or the **true positive rate (TPR)**, assesses the ratio of correctly identified positive instances among the total **actual** positive instances.

Recall is useful when the cost of false negatives is high.

## Formula

The precise definition of recall is the number of true positives divided by the number of true positives plus the number of false negatives.

$$
\text{Recall} = \frac{\text{Relevant retrieved instances}}{\text{All relevant instances}}
$$

- **Relevant retrieved instances:** Total correctly identified positive instances
- **All relevant instances:** Total actual positive instances
