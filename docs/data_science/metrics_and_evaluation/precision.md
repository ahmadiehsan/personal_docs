# Precision (PPV) [Imbalance]

## Description

Precision gauges the ratio of correctly identified positive instances to the total instances predicted as positive by the model. It is also referred to as **positive predictive value (PPV)**.

Precision proves valuable in scenarios where the expense associated with false positives is significant.

## Formula

Precision is defined as the number of true positives divided by the number of true positives plus the number of false positives.

$$
\text{Precision} = \frac{\text{Relevant retrieved instances}}{\text{All retrieved instances}}
$$

- **Relevant retrieved instances:** Total correctly identified positive instances
- **All retrieved instances:** Total instances predicted as positive
