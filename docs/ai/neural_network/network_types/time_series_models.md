# Time Series Models {Correlated Data}

## Description

There are several models specifically designed for time series data, such as

- AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)
- Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA)
- Prophet
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks

These models are designed to capture the dependencies and patterns in time series data and may outperform traditional machine learning models.
