# Pruning

## Description

Pruning is a model optimization technique used to reduce the size and computational complexity of a trained model while maintaining accuracy.
This is achieved by **identifying and removing redundant or less important parameters (weights)** or structures (neurons, channels, or layers).

Pruning is particularly useful for deploying complex AI models on resource-constrained devices like edge devices.
