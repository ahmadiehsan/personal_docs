# Refine

## Description

The refine chain improves the accuracy and quality of results through iterative refinement.
Each iteration feeds the output of the previous step into the next, enhancing the overall result.

Advantages:

- **Continuous improvement**: Allows for progressive refinement of output, enhancing the information iteratively.
- **Enhanced accuracy**: Improves accuracy and relevance through each iteration.

Disadvantages:

- **Increased computational resources**: Requires more computational resources due to iterative nature.
- **Longer processing time**: Each iteration adds to overall processing time, which might be a concern for real-time responses.

## Use Cases

- **Long-Form Text Generation**: Ideal for creating essays, articles, or stories, where iterative refinement ensures coherence and readability.
- **Answer Synthesis**: Combines answers derived from multiple sources iteratively, ensuring accuracy and comprehensiveness by integrating crucial contexts progressively.
