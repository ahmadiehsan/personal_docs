# Query Expansion [RAG]

## Description

Query expansion (QE) is a technique in information retrieval (IR) that improves search engine performance by adding relevant terms to a user's initial query.
This reformulation addresses the "vocabulary mismatch" problem, where users don't always use the exact words found in relevant documents.

QE enhances search recall by retrieving documents that share similar meaning with the original query but might use different keywords, leading to more comprehensive results.
