# Speculative RAG [RAG]

## Description

Speculative RAG is an approach that involves generating multiple possible responses or outputs for a given input query, using a retrieval model to provide relevant information.
The generated responses are then evaluated using a feedback mechanism to select the most plausible or relevant one.
The goal is to enhance the modelâ€™s ability to produce accurate and contextually appropriate answers, especially when there is ambiguity or multiple potential interpretations of a query.

## Workflow

- **Step 1 - Retrieval**: Similar to Standard RAG, it starts by retrieving multiple documents relevant to the query.
- **Step 2 - Generative Speculation**: The generative model creates multiple speculative responses based on the retrieved documents. Instead of producing a single answer, it explores several possible outputs.
- **Step 3 - Feedback and Ranking**: Each of the generated responses is evaluated using a feedback mechanism that scores them based on various criteria like relevance, coherence, completeness, and factual accuracy. This could involve comparing the responses against additional retrieved documents or using scoring models.
- **Step 4 - Selection Process**: The model ranks all possible responses and selects the highest-scoring one as the final output.
- **Step 5 - Presentation**: The chosen response is then presented to the user as the final answer.
