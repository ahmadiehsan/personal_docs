# Query Rewriting [RAG]

## Description

Query rewriting is the process of transforming user queries to improve retrieval accuracy and performance, either by enhancing the query for a database or by generating multiple query variations for a search engine to improve information retrieval.

This technique is used in both traditional database optimization and modern Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, where large language models (LLMs) rephrase vague questions, add keywords, and remove irrelevant details to better match document content, ultimately leading to more precise search results.
