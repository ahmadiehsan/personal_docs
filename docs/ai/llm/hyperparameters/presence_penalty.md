# Presence Penalty

## Description

The **Presence Penalty** is a parameter used to influence the diversity of topics generated by language models.
While it may seem similar to the **Repetition Penalty**, it focuses on discouraging or encouraging the model from revisiting previously mentioned topics or ideas, rather than just individual words or phrases.
This penalty helps the model either stay focused on the current topic or explore new and related topics.

In language generation, the model often tends to stay within the boundaries of the initially introduced idea, which can lead to excessive focus on a single theme.
The presence penalty encourages the model to shift its focus to new ideas, even if the exact words or phrases have not been repeated.
This results in more varied and diverse content, avoiding monotonous or repetitive discussions about the same topic.

## Workflow

The **Presence Penalty** can take values between -2 and +2:

- Positive values discourage the model from repeating or overemphasizing the current topic. It encourages the introduction of new ideas and concepts.
- Negative values increase the focus on the current topic, allowing the model to expand on it or revisit related aspects more frequently.

## Example

**High Presence Penalty (1.5)**:

User: "What is the current state of space exploration?"
Bot: "Humanity has made significant strides with Mars missions and the Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the Moon. There's also a growing interest in asteroid mining and commercial space travel."

User: "What are the biggest challenges for the future of space exploration?"
Bot: "Challenges include the cost of space missions, developing sustainable life support systems for long-duration space travel, and the need for innovative propulsion technologies."

    In this example, the model shifts its focus and doesn't revisit Mars or the Artemis program, instead addressing the challenges of space exploration from a different angle.

**Low Presence Penalty (0)**:

User: "What is the current state of space exploration?"
Bot: "Humanity has made significant strides with Mars missions and the Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the Moon. There's also a growing interest in asteroid mining and commercial space travel."

User: "What are the biggest challenges for the future of space exploration?"
Bot: "The challenges for space exploration include the cost of Mars missions, the need for sustainable life support systems for long-term missions, and the challenges of deep space exploration."

    Here, the model revisits Mars and related topics, providing a more focused continuation of the initial discussion.
