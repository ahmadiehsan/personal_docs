# Prompt Chaining

## Description

Prompt chaining is a technique in prompt engineering where complex tasks are broken down into subtasks. By prompting the model with these subtasks sequentially, it creates a chain of responses that lead to a final output.

This method enhances the model's reliability and performance, making it easier to debug and improve specific stages of the task.
