# Meta

## Description

Meta Prompting is a sophisticated technique in prompt engineering that emphasizes the structure and syntax of tasks rather than their content.
This approach aims to interact with large language models (LLMs) more abstractly.

This technique is effective for complex reasoning tasks, mathematical problems, coding challenges, and theoretical inquiries.

Key Characteristics:

- **Structure-oriented**: Focuses on the format of problems and solutions.
- **Syntax-focused**: Uses syntax as a guiding template.
- **Abstract examples**: Utilizes abstract frameworks for problem-solving.
- **Versatile**: Applicable across various domains.
- **Categorical approach**: Emphasizes logical arrangement and categorization.
