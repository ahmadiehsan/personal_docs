# Overview

## Description

Regularization is a technique used to add a penalty term to the loss function during training.
This helps reduce model complexity and prevent overfitting.

There are several types of regularization, including:

- L1 regularization (LASSO)
- L2 regularization (Ridge)
- Elastic net regularization
