# Stacking

## Description

Stacking is a popular ensemble learning technique that improves predictive performance by combining the outputs of multiple base models. It does this by training a higher-level model on the predictions of these base models.

## Workflow

1. **Split the training data** into two parts:

   - The first part is used to train the base models.
   - The second part is used to generate a new dataset of predictions from the base models.

2. **Train multiple base models** on the first part of the training data.
3. **Generate predictions** using the trained base models on the second part of the training data, creating a new dataset of predictions.
4. **Train a higher-level model** (also called a meta-model or blender) using this new dataset of predictions as input features.
5. **Make final predictions** on test data using the trained higher-level model.

The higher-level model is typically a simple algorithm, such as linear regression, logistic regression, or a decision tree. Its goal is to learn how to optimally combine the predictions of the base models, leading to improved overall accuracy.
